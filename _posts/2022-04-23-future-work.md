Some potential avenues for our work include improving customer service interactions between customers and 
employee representatives and potentially providing those with hearing loss issues accessibility to more information
when conversing with people. Extending our project to meet these goals involves a variety of different future improvements
including training our model with more data containing a wider range of voices and accents. With more data, the model
can learn different voice patterns and more accurately predict an emotion. We will also attempt to model more emotions
than the 4 we focused on in this project in order to widen the range of applications for our web application.

In terms of our data modeling, we could potentially harness transfer learning to achieve a better classifier. There
are pretrained models that have been trained with thousands of images such as ImageNet and therefore are rubost in 
feature extraction.
